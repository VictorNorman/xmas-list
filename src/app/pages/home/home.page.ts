 * Making groups of users:
 * 1. Someone has to make the group. It gets a name, and unique id from firebase.
 *    Tell the user to send the unique id to others.  Does this person have a unique role?  Group admin??
 * 2. After login, if user has no group, then ask for unique id.  When entered, add user to that group.
 *    If user has 1 group, go to group page.  If user has > 1 group, have them choose which.
 * 3. Need page to remove a group, and remove a user from a group.  Who can do this?
 * 4.
